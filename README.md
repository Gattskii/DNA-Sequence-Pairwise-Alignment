# DNA-Sequence-Pairwise-Alignment
Comparing DNA sequences using pairwise alignment

This program is written in Python and executed in a Google Collab environment.

It is better to paste this program in Google Collab environment to run the code by blocks!

Code Summary:
1. The program retrieve DNA sequence from NCBI, you must insert your own email address for the NCBI access
2. Translating the DNA to proteins
3. Checking if theres any mutation in the DNA
4. Analyzing base compositions of the DNA Sequence
5. Calculating GC Skewness
6. Finally, retrieving and align the sequences of choice using pairwise sequence alignment
